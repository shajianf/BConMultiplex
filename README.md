# BConMultiplex
In this project, we simulate two-layers multiplex networks. On the above layer, we use the Watts Threshold model and On the other layer, we apply the SIS model.

Using the uniform distribution, we consider a special threshold value for every node in the threshold model. We allocate every threshold value to every node by using Betweenness centrality (BC) from big to small. For example, one node with the biggest BC value has the biggest threshold value.

We aim to see if the important nodes illustrate good resistance against changing their states, how much does the density of the active nodes gets changed?

I usually try to my code get easy to learn more:)
